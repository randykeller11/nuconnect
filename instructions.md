# Panel Design Guidelines

Below is a narrative specification for how every content panel should look and feel. Share this with your AI coding tool to guide the visual implementation, rather than relying on precise CSS rules.

## Visual Structure

1. **Background**

   * Panels float above the page’s teal-to-parchment gradient.
   * Each panel’s fill is a translucent white (90–95% opacity) so the subtle texture of the gradient shows through gently around the edges.

2. **Shape & Border**

   * Corners are softly rounded (approximately 8px radius) for a friendly, modern feel.
   * No heavy outlines; instead, panels are visually separated by shadow and contrast.

3. **Elevation & Shadow**

   * Panels cast a gentle, even drop-shadow.
   * Shadow is soft (blur radius 10–12px) and light (opacity \~5%), giving panels a sense of floating without harshness.

4. **Highlight Accent**

   * A slender gold stripe (2–4px high) runs flush along the top edge of panels that require emphasis.
   * This stripe uses a subtle gradient between your brand’s two gold tones to catch the eye.

## Typography & Color

1. **Heading Treatment**

   * Use a bold-weight geometric sans serif (e.g. Poppins) in a deep teal tone.
   * Headings are large and clear (roughly 28–32px on desktop), with generous spacing below.

2. **Body Copy**

   * Set in a neutral, humanist sans serif (e.g. Inter) in dark charcoal or deep gray for optimal legibility.
   * Line height is comfortable (1.5–1.7), and paragraphs or list items have clear vertical spacing.

3. **Call-to-Action**

   * Buttons or links are in your gold accent color or solid teal, with white text for contrast.
   * Button shapes are subtly rounded (4px radius) to harmonize with panel corners.
   * Hover/focus states darken or enrich the color slightly for feedback.

## Additional Details

1. **Forms & Inputs**

   * Input fields live inside panels and share the same rounded corners (4–6px) and white background.
   * Fields are separated by clear margin space and have subtle borders or underlines in light gray.
   * On focus, input borders shift to a muted teal tone and may show a faint ring for accessibility.

2. **Iconography & Motifs**

   * Small decorative motifs (e.g. a rounded diamond or subtle wave) may appear at very low opacity (5–10%) in panel corners to echo the background illustrations.
   * Icons used alongside headings or CTAs should use the same gold accent or teal tertiary color for consistency.

3. **Spacing & Layout**

   * Panels sit at the center or edge of the viewport with generous horizontal padding (at least 1.5rem on mobile, 2rem on desktop).
   * Vertical spacing between panels is ample (3–4rem) to let the gradient breathe and maintain separation.

**Resulting Effect:**

When implemented, each panel should feel like a crisp, elevated card hovering over an organic, textured backdrop. The white translucency, soft shadows, and gold accent unify the look, while the typography choices ensure clarity and warmth. Together, these elements create a professional, inviting user experience without clashing against the rich gradient background.
