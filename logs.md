Based on the PDF you shared, here’s how I’d make the **Professional Focus** onboarding step feel cleaner and more impactful while still capturing rich profile data for your use case.

## **1. Reduce Visual Clutter**

* **Group Related Sections into Collapsible Panels**
  Instead of showing *Industries*, *Skills*, *Interests*, and *Seniority* all at once, break them into collapsible or progressive panels (e.g., “Step 2A – Industries”, “Step 2B – Skills”…). This keeps focus on one decision at a time.
* **Use Visual Chips with Icons**
  Represent each industry, skill, and interest as a compact pill/chip with an icon (e.g., 💻 for AI, 🎨 for Creative/Arts, 🌱 for Sustainability) to help users quickly scan and choose.

---

## **2. Improve Professional Focus Depth**

* **Industries**

  * Expand beyond the current set with subcategories for precision (e.g., “Tech & Startups” → “SaaS,” “Cybersecurity,” “Biotech”).
  * Add an “Other (type in)” option for unlisted sectors.
* **Skills**

  * Provide category filters at the top (Tech, Business, Creative, People Skills) so users can toggle instead of scrolling a long list.
  * Allow bulk add from LinkedIn import to speed up selection.
* **Interests**

  * Add “Event Networking Goals” options (e.g., “Find a co-founder,” “Hire talent,” “Discover investment opportunities”).
* **Seniority**

  * Include “Student / Career Transition” to cover non-traditional paths.

## **3. Make Primary Skill Selection More Intuitive**

* Replace “Double-click to set as Primary” with a **clear ‘Set Primary’ button** or a **star icon toggle** that appears on hover.
* Show the chosen primary skill in a distinct highlight color above the list for clarity.

---

## **4. Enhance Guidance & Conversion**

* Add a **progress bar subtext** with encouragement (“These details help us make smarter matches at your next event.”).
* Include small **tooltips or ‘Why This Matters’ pop-ups** for each section so users understand how their selections impact AI matching.

## **5. Profile Photo Storage Integration**

Since you noted the profile photo isn’t saving to Supabase storage:

* Store uploads in the **`avatars` bucket** with path convention: `avatars/{user_id}/{filename}`.
* On successful upload, save the **public or signed URL** to `profile_photo_url` in the `profiles` table.
* If replacing an image, delete the old file from the bucket to avoid orphaned storage.
